Your program (StateCapitals3) must have the following features:

It will be a Java Console Application called StateCapitals3.
It will have a class called Capital with the following properties:
Name
Population
Square mileage
It will have another class with your main method called StateCapitalsApp.
This class will have a main method.
The main method will include a HashMap declared to map the name of a state to its corresponding Capital object. (State name is the key, Capital object is the value.)
Next, using your data unmarshalling strategy to use this linked file to create all appropriate Capital objects and store them under their appropriate state name in your HashMap:
MoreStateCapitals.txt
Print out a message detailing how many State Capitals were loaded into your HashMap.
Next, print out each state and its capitals name, population, and square mileage to the screen.
Hint: Use the key set to get each Capital object out of the map one by one and then print each field of the Capital object to the screen.
Then, prompt the user for a population limit, print out all states & their capitals who have a population over that limit.
Hint: You will have to add code to ask the user for a minimum population. Once you have this value, go through each state/capital pair as you did for the last step, but only print the information for capitals that have a population above the limit.
Finally, prompt the user for an area limit, print out all states & their capitals who have an area under that limit.
