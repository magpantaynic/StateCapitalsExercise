Your program (StateCapitals2) must have the following features:

This program will be a Java Console Application called StateCapitals2.
Create a HashMap to hold the names of all the states and their corresponding capital names. (State name is still the key, & the capital name is the value.)
Load the HashMap with each state/capital pair using this file: StateCapitals.txt.
Save the file in your project top level.
After loading, print out how many state/capitals pairs are inside your map.
Then print out all the state names to the screen.
Lastly - make a small knowledge game.
Choose a random state, and prompt the user to input its capital.
Tell them if they got it right!
Stretch goal:
Ask them how many they want to guess, and choose that many states. (Don't allow duplicates!)
Give them a point for each correct guess, and subtract one for each miss.
Print out a total score at the end.
