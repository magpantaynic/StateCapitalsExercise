Your program (StateCapitals) must include the following:

This program will be a Java Console Application called StateCapitals.
Create a HashMap to hold the names of all the states and their corresponding capital names. (State name is the key, capital name is the value.)
Load the HashMap with each state/capital pair. (This should be hard-coded.)
Print all of the state names to the screen. (Hint: Get the keys from the map and then print each state name one by one.)
Print all of the capital names to the screen. (Hint: Get the values from the map and then print each capital name to the screen one by one.)
Print each state along with its capital to the screen. (Hint: Use the key set to get each value from the map one by one, printing both the key and value as you go.)
